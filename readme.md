# Project Description
Finding a mentor can be challenging, especially for marginalized students who often lack access to professional networks, structured guidance, and relatable role models. Without mentorship, students can feel isolated, unsure of their career paths, and struggle with imposter syndrome, financial stress, and systemic barriers.

ThrivePath is more than an app, it’s a personal mentor for marginalized students who don’t have easy access to traditional mentorship. With tools to track progress, reframe self-doubt, and plan academic and career goals, ThrivePath empowers students to navigate college life with confidence. Whether you're a first-generation student, balancing financial pressures, or overcoming feelings of imposter syndrome, ThrivePath provides the structure, motivation, and support you need to succeed.
